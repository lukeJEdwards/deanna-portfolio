                Originally from Brighton, Deanna is an illustrator with a unique focus on bright, bold colour palettes
                that
                immerse her audience in the artwork's narrative. Her work primarily involves traditional practice, with
                a
                particular emphasis on Acrylic Paint and Charcoal Sketches. In recent years, she has also ventured into
                digital
                art, honing her Adobe Fresco and Photoshop skills.
